## Contributing

Please don't send Pull Requests—if you would like a feature or a change, I encourage you to fork this repo and add your changes instead. If you spot a potential improvement over the current setup without changing the functionality, then feel free to open an Issue to review the idea. Still, this config is for my own use and I've published it as reference and just in case it's useful for someone else, but it's purpose is not to fulfill public needs.
