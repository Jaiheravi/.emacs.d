# My Emacs Setup

This Emacs config aims to provide a nice editing experience for me. Focusing on clarity and simplicity. 

*It's meant to be used in the terminal*, so don't expect it to work nicely on the GUI version of Emacs. The reason for this is that the Emacs GUI has an absolutely ridiculous bug where you can't properly set the line height of the text and make the cursor follow that height, especially at the end of the lines where the cursor goes back to the default setting. On the other hand, terminals are pure text and they manage how the text is shown, so Emacs' visual nonsense doesn't apply.

Please don't send Pull Requests—if you would like a feature or a change, I encourage you to fork this repo and add your changes instead. If you spot a potential improvement over the current setup without changing the functionality, then feel free to open an Issue to review the idea. Still, this config is for my own use and I've published it as reference and just in case it's useful for someone else, but it's purpose is not to fulfill public needs.
