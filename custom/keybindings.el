;; I need a way to know all the keybindings I'm defining so I don't make the
;; mistake of repeating them. Also as a reference to know all the keybindings
;; that I have defined. Also, some of these keybindings have "chained" letters
;; and are they are meant to be used inside (use-package) for simplicity. Those
;; that are not "chained" are usuallt for global keybindings.

;; Sample usage:
;;   (getkey "fold-block")

;; (use-package
;;   ...
;;   :bind ((getkey "filesystem-tree") . treemacs)
